MAKE BATTER
- Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
- Add oil to a measuring jug that holds at least 1 cup. Add the egg then fill the jug to the 1-cup line with milk (1/3 to 1/2 cup milk). Add vanilla and whisk to combine.
- Add milk mixture to the bowl with dry ingredients then use a fork to combine. Do not over mix. (The muffin batter will be quite thick — see note below for more details). Fold in the blueberries.
BAKE MUFFINS
- Divide the batter between muffin cups. (If making big-topped muffins, the batter will come to the tops of the paper liners). Sprinkle a little sugar on top of each muffin.
- Bake muffins 15 to 20 minutes or until tops are no longer wet and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out with crumbs, not wet batter. Transfer to a cooling rack.

- To make the popovers: Use a standard 12-cup metal muffin tin, one whose cups are close to 2 1/2 inches wide x 1 1/2 inches deep. Grease the pan thoroughly, covering the area between the cups as well as the cups themselves. Make sure the oven is up to temperature before you begin to make the popover batter.

Stop, scrape the sides of the bowl, and whisk for an additional 20 to 30 seconds at high speed, till frothy.

If the popovers seem to be browning too quickly, position an oven rack at the very top of the oven, and put a cookie sheet on it, to shield the popover tops from direct heat.
- If you plan on serving the popovers immediately, remove them from the oven, and stick the tip of a knife into the top of each, to release steam and help prevent sogginess. Slip them out of the pan, and serve alongside the sweet butter.
- If you want the popovers to hold their shape longer without deflating and settling quite as much, bake them for an additional 5 minutes (for a total of 40 minutes) IF you can do so without them becoming too dark.

- This is a very soft dough, so you will need to treat it a bit differently than most yeast doughs. If you have a stand mixer, beat the dough using the flat beater paddle until it starts coming away from the sides of the bowl, and is satin-smooth and shiny; this will take about 5 minutes at medium-high speed. When you lift up the beater, the dough will be very stretchy. If you have a bread machine, simply use the dough cycle.
- Scrape the dough into a rough ball, and cover the bowl. Let the dough rise until it is nice and puffy; this will take 1 to 2 hours or so.
- Prepare your griddle(s). Using two griddles allows you to cook all the muffins at once; but since you probably do not have two griddles, you will need to cook the muffins in shifts. Whatever you use — an electric griddle, stovetop griddle, frying pan, electric frying pan — sprinkle it heavily with semolina or farina. If you are using a griddle or frying pan that is not well-seasoned (or non-stick), spray it with non-stick vegetable oil spray first, before adding the semolina or farina.
- Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into 16 pieces. Shape each piece into a smooth ball, then flatten the balls until they are about 3 to 3 1/2 inches in diameter.
- The easiest way to handle and cook these muffins is to lay them right onto the cold surface you will be frying them on. That way, you do not have to move them once they are risen; and they will not mind cooking very slowly as you fire the griddle up to its desired heat. If you do not have enough griddle space to do this, sprinkle a baking sheet heavily with semolina or farina, and place the muffins on the sheet; they can be fairly close together. Either way, sprinkle the tops of the muffins with additional semolina or farina.
- Cover the muffins (a piece of parchment works well), and let them rest for 20 minutes. They will not rise like crazy, but will puff a bit.
- Cook the muffins over low heat for 7 to 15 minutes per side, until their crust is golden brown, and their interior is cooked through. When done, the center of a muffin should register about 200°F on an instant-read thermometer. If you find the muffins have browned before they are cooked all the way through, no worries; simply pop them into a preheated 350°F oven for about 10 minutes or so, or until they are thoroughly cooked.
- Remove the muffins from the griddle (or oven), and let them cool thoroughly before enjoying. Remember: use a fork to split, not a knife to cut. Fork-split muffins will have wonderful nooks and crannies; knife-cut ones will not.',350, 30, 16);
